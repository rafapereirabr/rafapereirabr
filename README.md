### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rafael Pereira (Rafa for short). I work as a researcher and head of the spatial data science team at the Department of Regional, Urban and Environmental Studies and Policies at the Institute for Applied Economic Research (Ipea) in Brazil.

My research looks broadly at how urban and transport policies shape the spatial organization of cities, human mobility patterns as well as their impacts on social and health inequalities. I am particularly interested in the equity concerns underlying impact assessment of urban and transport planning policies and their effects on inequalities in access to opportunities.
