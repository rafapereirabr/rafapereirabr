### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
---
My name is Rafael H. M. Pereira (Rafa for short). I work as a senior researcher and head of data science at the [Institute for Applied Economic Research (Ipea)](https://www.ipea.gov.br/portal/index.php?option=com_content&view=frontpage&Itemid=61) in Brazil.

### Research interests :satellite:
---
My research looks broadly at the intersection of urban analytics, spatial data science, mobility and urban studies. I investigate how urban and transport policies shape the spatial organization of cities, human mobility patterns as well as their impacts on social and health inequalities. I am particularly interested in the equity concerns underlying the impacts of urban and transport planning policies and their effects on inequalities in access to opportunities.

- Transport justice
- Cities and Equity
- Spatial Data Science
- Transport policies
